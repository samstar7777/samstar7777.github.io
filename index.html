      <p><span style="font-size:24px">This is a funny</span> little story from when I first came here and
        started teaching English.<br><br> It takes awhile to get used to communicating
        in english with people whose second language is english.
        when you do it all the time for a long period, you learn well
        how to do it, but when you first start--- you make a lot of
        mistakes. One funny moment from my first year here
        was when I was talking to a group of 4 students about Star Wars. Somehow Han Solo came up as a topic (I am not sure
        if I was trying to tell them about the time I was a cook in New Orleans and made food for Harrison Ford and made
        an excuse to return some
        gorgonzola to the cheese closet at the side of the bar so
        I could get a peek at him. There he was, eating his pizza.
        he was in town filming Looper). Anyway, they did not know
        who Han Solo was... I tried to think "how can I explain?" I got
        really excited "...he's the pilot of the Millenium Falcon!" You
        don't need to be Galen Erso to figure out that
        if a group of people don't know a certain fictional character
        inside a movie, that they have almost zero chance of knowing
        the name of the spaceship they pilot. The teacher teaching
        in the room next to me overheard and talked to me about it
        in the teachers room between lessons. We had a good laugh and I think he suggested that I mention the fact that
        “It's the ship that made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs!”
